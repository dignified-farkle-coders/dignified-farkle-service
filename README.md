## Description
Farkle is a simple game where you roll dice to accumulate points. When your die give you points
you set those aside and choose whether to risk those points by rolling the remaining die or pass
the die to the next player, locking in your current points. 

In our version of the game, we would like to add special features that the player or die can have 
such as having the ability to shoot another players die, or add an extra die to a specified 
roll. Maybe even have the die have the ability to level up and so a particular die would have a 
higher chance of landing on a 4 for example. These extra ideas we are tossing around are part 
of our stretch goals. 

Along with extra die and player features, we would also like to implement a global ranking, 
tournaments, and player stats such as highest single roll score, win to loss ratio, and fewest 
rounds played in a win game.
